The purpose of this project is to create a Python application that will
take an arbitrary Java .class file and output the Java bytecode 
corresponding to the methods that make up the .class file.

This is not a "decompiler" that generates Java source code. Those exist
and are pretty buggy. I wanted something more reliable.
